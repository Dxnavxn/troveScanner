        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>ec is a terminal merge-conflict helper that focuses on resolving git conflicts file by file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It uses a three-way comparison between base, ours, and theirs, so you can see what changed on each side and build a result. You can pick whole sections from either side, copy lines across, and write the merged file back in place safely. It can also step through every conflicted file in a repo and run as a git mergetool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This tool includes an optional diff3 output when base is available, non-interactive modes for scripts, backups of merged files, and a "list conflicts" mode when you run it with no args. There&rsquo;s also a <a href="/neovim/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neovim</a> plugin to launch it in a terminal buffer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ec works best for developers working with in long rebases, merges, and cherry-picks who want a repeatable way to clear conflicts without leaving the terminal.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>pdfgrep is a CLI tool for searching text inside PDF files. It works similarly to&nbsp;<code>grep</code>, with the key difference that matches are reported by page number instead of line number in PDF files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Key features include support for many common <code>grep</code> flags (recursive search, case-insensitive search, etc.) and the ability to search multiple PDF files at once. It highlights matches in color and supports regular expressions for complex queries, caching on large files and quiet output support, perhaps for use in scripting. This tool can even search in password-protected PDF files if you provide the password.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Archivists, researchers, students and IT professionals will find pdfgrep useful for sifting through large collections of PDF documents for specific terms. It&rsquo;s especially handy for quickly locating information in e-books, research papers, or other PDF files without opening them one by one.</p>]]></content>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It analyzes your project's source and its dependencies, then produces a tree view of the dependency graph annotated with statistics about unsafe usage. Crates that declare <code>#![forbid(unsafe_code)]</code> (forbidding unsafe) are marked accordingly, helping you identify which dependencies are entirely safe code and which contain some unsafe components.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also generates a safety report that highlights how many unsafe code blocks and functions are present in each crate, acting like a geiger counter for your codebase by measuring the "radioactivity" of unsafe Rust in your dependency tree.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>cargo-geiger is valuable for Rust developers and teams concerned with code safety. It allows you to quickly gauge the "safety health" of your project, which is especially important in security-sensitive applications or when vetting third-party libraries.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>intentrace is a CLI tool similar to strace(1) that traces a program&rsquo;s system calls but also interprets their purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It intercepts each system call a process makes and uses heuristics to infer the high-level action it represents, so the output shows not just raw calls but also context to aid debugging. It can attach to a running process or start a new one, supports tracing child processes (forks), allows filtering by specific calls or only failed calls, and can produce a summary report of all calls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This tool is useful for anyone who needs insight into a program&rsquo;s system-level behavior. It&rsquo;s helpful for diagnosing bugs or crashes by showing what each syscall does in a more readable format than strace(1).</p>]]></content>

<p>Just like what you can also do in the web client, it has a full post composer (with character count, polls, content warnings, etc.) and renders images inline with support for ANSI, Sixel and TGP. Actions such as like, boost, or reply are done with keyboard shortcuts and it supports built-in light/dark themes and has configurable refresh intervals per timeline.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's ideal for people who want to access Mastodon without using a graphical browser but want to use a terminal user interface instead or want an alternative to other Mastodon TUI clients such as <a class="tt-link" href="/toot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toot</a>.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>systeroid is a CLI tool for configuring Linux kernel parameters and is essentially "sysctl on steroids". It can display variables in tree or JSON format and lets you filter by name or section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can get or set values individually or in bulk, load settings from config files, and apply system-wide settings. The --explain option shows documentation for each kernel parameter. It also supports verbose logging. An optional interactive mode provides a text interface with search and editing for /proc/sys values. It also has a TUI for those who prefer a text mode interface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This helps system administrators, system programmers or kernel developers tweak and audit system settings directly in the terminal. It&rsquo;s useful for performance tuning, security hardening or debugging kernel parameters on any Linux/BSD system and serves as an alternative to the standard sysctl command.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p dir="auto">difftastic is a structural syntax-aware diff tool that compares files based on their syntax instead of raw lines.</p>
<p dir="auto">&nbsp;</p>
<p data-start="108" data-end="586">It parses code with tree-sitter, builds syntax trees, matches expressions instead of lines, supports and detects over 50+ programming languages and can be integrated with Git as an alternative diff tool to replace the internal built-in version provided by Git. Many other version control systems (VCSs) is supported with difftastic such as Mercurial, Fossil, and Jujutsu.</p>
<p data-start="588" data-end="815">&nbsp;</p>
<p data-start="588" data-end="815">difftastic is used by developers, reviewers, and maintainers who read lots of diffs, especially on large codebases when you care about real semantic changes rather than blocks of lines changed in a commit or want cleaner, more focused diffs during development across many complex projects regardless of the programming language.</p>]]></content>
